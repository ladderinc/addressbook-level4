**Search Pruning feature with find commands:**

With the introduction of v1.1, NUSSU Connect now includes a Search Pruning feature that helps you
trim the list of contacts with every successive find command. This lets you search through the list
of contacts in a much more intuitive manner without the hassle of typing a long single line command that is
usually error-prone.

The concept of the Search Pruning feature will be further illustrated below.
****
*Assume that the original list of contacts contains the following 3 persons.*

image::InitialList.png[align="left"]

*After executing the command `find \tag VIP`* +
*the displayed list will now contain 2 persons, both with the tag 'VIP'*

image::SecondList.png[align="left"]

*Executing another command `find \tag President`* +
*will filter according to the previous displayed list instead of the original list* +
*The displayed list now contains only 1 person with the tag 'President'* +
